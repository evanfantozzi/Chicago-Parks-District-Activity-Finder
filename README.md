## ðŸŒ³ Welcome to *Chicago Activity Finder!*

Did you know the Chicago Park District offers tons of amazing events year-round? Unfortunately, they can be surprisingly hard to find. A friend of mine shared their frustration with the existing Park District websites, [don't allow distance-based searches](https://anc.apm.activecommunities.com/chicagoparkdistrict/activity/search?) and are [hard to navigate through](https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/news/category/programs).

This web app started from the idea that finding public events with availability should be quick and seamless. My hope is that it helps my friends â€” and other Chicago residents â€” more easily explore free and low-cost programming across the city.

With that in mind, the app lets you:

- **Search for activities by proximity** â€” use your current location or manually enter any Chicago address. You can also add or remove individual parks/facilities from the list of searched areas.
- **Filter by age group and activity type** â€” to narrow your results based on what matters to you.
- **Fetch real-time available listings** â€” pulled directly from the Chicago Park District, with multiple sessions grouped into single, clean listings.
- **View everything on an interactive map** â€” complete with clickable markers, activity popups, and direct registration links.

I built this using **Flask**, **Leaflet**, and a spatial SQLite database to support distance-based queries. The app's scraper interacts with the Park Districtâ€™s internal API, and the frontend is styled to work cleanly across both desktop and mobile.
